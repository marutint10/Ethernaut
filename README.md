# Ethernaut Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for all the challenges on the Ethernaut platform.

**About Ethernaut**
Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity-based wargame inspired by overthewire.org. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

**Acknowledgments**

Thanks to OpenZeppelin for creating the Ethernaut platform, and to the Solidity community for their valuable resources.

Feel free to fork, modify and submit pull requests with improvements or new solutions. Happy hacking!
